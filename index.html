        <h2>
          What is Park Spot?
        </h2>
          We connect the driver who is looking for a free parking spot with people who live around the area. 
          We offer a service to find available parking space in cities where it is hard to find public street parking spots.
        <h2>
          Get started?
        </h2>
          Just search on street name or zip code and all available spots around your destination will be displayed.
        <h2>
          How does it work?
        </h2>
          Park Spot works with people who living in the city and crowdsource the information. If someone sees a free spot the spot can be added to the website. 
          Of course there will be a reward for adding free spots.
        <h2>
          How much will it cost?
        </h2>
          The first months will be free. But after that we will let user get subscription based on there needs, such as package per month based on their needs. 
          Yes we are looking into unlimited package deals as well. 
        <h2>
          I do not see a free spot?
        </h2>
          No worries, we are working on a request function. This will notify someone nearby and can tell you if there is a space around your destination.
        <h2>
          Can I make money as contributer?
        </h2>
          Yes, we understand that we should encourage contribution. We are currently looking into pay out details but this will most likely based on your contribution.
          So making more contribution will get you more money. We also working on request function and thus a bigger reward.
        <h2>
          Status?
        </h2>
          Currently Park Spot is in development and all data is fake. Leave your <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/dhJWZchFqjtJp8Wn2" target="_blanc">email</a> and we will notify once we are live.
        <h2>
          Contact?
        </h2>          
          We are looking for testers who want to contribute and earn some money. But also drivers who need a free space for their car.
